# IDestructiveCase.CleanupAsync method

Performs cleanup of any resources created by the test case.

```csharp
public Task CleanupAsync()
```

## Remarks

Conceptually, this occurs after all test initialization and assertions are complete.

Use this method to undo changes which might impact other tests or the executing environment.

Usage examples: remove database records seeded during "arrange" (reducing unexpected collisions with other tests), deleting files created by "act" (saving storage space), delete or revoke temporary permissions/authorization specific to this test case (reducing security exposure).
