# ICasePhases.AcquireSanityValuesAsync method

Performs non-destructive steps to acquire "sanity" values which may be used by test assertions (test case initialization phase 2 of 4).

```csharp
public Task AcquireSanityValuesAsync()
```

## Remarks

This method should perform calculations and queries to establish post-arrangement, pre-act conditions. Values obtained during this test case initialization phase are useful for "sanity" tests: tests which make assertions to ensure that assumptions or expectations are correct.

Examples: query a database to verify that seeded data exists, store an object property's value prior to an [`ActAsync`](./ActAsync.md) expected to change it, determine whether a file or directory exists before an [`ActAsync`](./ActAsync.md) expected to create or update it.
