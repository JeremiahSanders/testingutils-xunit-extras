# SharedCaseContextAttribute class

Attribute which declares that this `class` (the `class` to which it is applied) is designed to be a "shared case context." Applying this attribute triggers the generation of an `abstract` base test case arrangement fixture `class` and an `abstract` base test "assertion" `class`, via [`SharedCaseContextGenerator`](../Jds.TestingUtils.Xunit2.Extras.Generators/SharedCaseContextGenerator.md). The generated classes will be named to match this class, but with a suffix: "Fixture", and "Assertions". For example, if this class is named `ExampleSharedContext`, then the generated classes would be named `ExampleSharedContextFixture` and `ExampleSharedContextAssertions`.

```csharp
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
public class SharedCaseContextAttribute : Attribute
```

## Remarks

A shared case context is understood to be a lightweight object which exposes `readonly`, immutable properties.

The properties exposed by a shared case context are generally common configuration or "seed data" values.
