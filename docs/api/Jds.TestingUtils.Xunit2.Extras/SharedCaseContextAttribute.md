# SharedCaseContextAttribute class

Attribute which declares that this `class` (the `class` to which it is applied) is designed to be a "shared case context." Applying this attribute triggers the generation of an `abstract` base test case fixture `class`, via [`SharedCaseContextGenerator`](./SharedCaseContextGenerator.md). The generated test case fixture `class` will be named to match this class, with a "Fixture" suffix. For example, if this class is named `ExampleSharedContext`, then the generated `class` would be named `ExampleSharedContextFixture`.

```csharp
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
public class SharedCaseContextAttribute : Attribute
```

## Remarks

A shared case context is understood to be a lightweight object which exposes `readonly`, immutable properties.

The properties exposed by a shared case context are generally common configuration or "seed data" values.
