# ICasePhases.AcquireVerificationValuesAsync method

Performs non-destructive steps to acquire post-act conditions (test case initialization phase 4 of 4).

```csharp
public Task AcquireVerificationValuesAsync()
```

## Remarks

This method should perform calculations and queries to acquire post-act values which may be used by test assertions. Values obtained during this test case initialization phase provide the primary basis for "side effect" assertions.

Examples: query a database to verify that expected data changed, query a logging persistence abstraction for logged messages, read a file which [`ActAsync`](./ActAsync.md) was expected to have written.
